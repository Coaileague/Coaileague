# AutoForce™

## Overview
AutoForce™ (Autonomous Workforce Management Solutions) is a comprehensive workforce management platform for emergency services and other service-related industries. It aims to streamline operations, reduce administrative burdens, and act as a single source of truth for workforce management. Key capabilities include time tracking, automated invoice generation, smart hiring, compliance audit trails, and real-time analytics. The platform utilizes an "OS" design philosophy for extensibility and aims for a subscription and usage-based AI revenue model.

## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations.
Do not make changes to the folder `Z`.
Do not make changes to the file `Y`.
All branding must be 100% AutoForce™ (not WorkforceOS).
FTC COMPLIANCE: All marketing claims must be factual and verifiable. Avoid monopolistic language.
No Refresh Buttons.
Role-Aware Settings Gear:
  - Regular users → Organization settings (`/settings`)
  - Support roles (leaders, deputy admins) → Admin tools (`/admin-command-center`)
  - ROOT/SYSOP admins → Platform management (`/platform-admin`)
Universal Back Navigation: Every page, modal, dialog needs clear exit/cancel/back buttons.
Unsaved Changes Protection: Forms and pages with editable content must warn users before navigation/close.

## System Architecture
AutoForce™ is built on a modular "OS" design philosophy (e.g., BillOS™, PayrollOS™, TrackOS™) for clean code and extensibility.

### Advanced Billing & Usage-Based Pricing
A hybrid pricing model combines subscriptions with overage charges for AI-powered modules based on token usage. Non-AI modules use a flat subscription. Monthly token allowances are tracked per workspace, with overage usage billed profitably.

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a professional aesthetic using Deep Charcoal, Platinum neutrals, and Emergency Green accents. It prioritizes a mobile-first approach with responsive layouts and accessible touch targets. Branding includes an "AF" lightning bolt logo within a circular green gradient badge. User-facing pages consistently use emerald/green/teal colors, a uniform dark gradient background, and emerald accents.

**Navigation Improvements (November 2025)**:
- **Floating Header**: Sticky header (`position: sticky`) floats over content when scrolling without overlapping sidebar or demo banner. Semi-transparent with backdrop blur for modern aesthetic.
- **Visible Labels**: All navigation buttons include text labels on larger screens (Menu, Search, Tutorial, Settings/Admin) plus tooltips for clarity. Users know what each button does.
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Contextual breadcrumbs (Home > Section > Page) help users understand their location and navigate back easily. Automatically hidden on dashboard/home where not needed.

Key mobile-first PWA features include:
- Comprehensive mobile-first CSS variables for breakpoints, touch targets (48px minimum), spacing, typography, and safe areas.
- Complete Progressive Web App setup with manifest.json and a service worker for offline support and caching.
- A `ResponsiveAppFrame` provider with a `useMobile()` hook for device detection and PWA install prompts.
- CSS utility classes for mobile-specific elements like touch targets, safe areas, and navigation.
- Adaptive navigation that transforms the desktop sidebar into a bottom navigation bar on mobile.
- Mobile layout primitives such as `MobilePageWrapper`, `MobilePageHeader`, `MobileGrid`, and `MobileBottomSheet`.
- Touch gestures like pull-to-refresh and swipeable gestures.
- Performance optimizations including lazy loading for images and asset caching via the service worker.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript, Wouter, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui, `react-hook-form`, `zod`.
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, with Zod for validation.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Authentication**: Custom session-based authentication supporting Replit Auth (OIDC) and Custom Auth, including bcrypt, account locking, and password reset.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Data isolation is managed on a workspace basis.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A comprehensive two-tier hierarchical role system separates platform support (e.g., `root_admin`, `support_agent`) from organization/tenant management (e.g., `org_owner`, `staff`). Platform roles are managed centrally, while workspace roles are assigned per-employee. Type safety is enforced via TypeScript, and authorization uses guard middleware with new role names.
- **Communication**: Utilizes an IRC-style WebSocket command/response architecture.
    - **HelpDesk (Consolidated Chat System)**: **UPDATED November 2025** - Features a unified `/chat` experience with AI integration and usage-based billing:
        - **Desktop/Tablet**: `/chat` → HelpDesk5 with Gemini AI, connection error handling, professional UI
        - **Mobile**: `/mobile-chat` → Mobile-optimized experience
        - **Legacy Redirects**: `/live-chat`, `/helpdesk5`, `/support/chat` redirect to `/chat`
        - **Public Access**: Open to all users including guests (no authentication required). Guests can chat for support but AI features are disabled. Ticket holders prioritized.
        - **Gemini AI Integration**: User-provided API key (gemini-2.0-flash-exp), context-aware responses, toggle + "Ask AI" button, graceful degradation
        - **AI Access Control**: AI features (Gemini, Help Bot) require workspace membership for billing. Guests get human support only with friendly "AI unavailable" messages.
        - **Connection Error Handling**: MAX_RETRIES=5 with exponential backoff, error dialog with Report Bug/Retry/Go Home options
        - **Usage-Based Billing** (**CRITICAL**): All AI token usage (Gemini + HelpOS bot) is automatically tracked and billed to workspace customers via `usageMeteringService`. Feature keys: `helpdesk_gemini_chat`, `helpdesk_ai_greeting`, `helpdesk_ai_response`, `helpdesk_ai_analysis`. Zero-cost AI for guests (disabled), full billing for workspace users. This ensures platform profitability on AI features.
    - **CommOS™**: Organization-specific chatrooms with role-based access, supporting private messages (AES-256-GCM encrypted), message reactions, threading, file uploads, @mentions, read receipts, rich text formatting, live room browser, and full-text search. Also includes WebRTC-powered voice/video calling.

    - **HelpOS™ Autonomous Bot**: **UPDATED November 2025** - An intelligent support agent with usage-based billing. Provides bot-first assistance with human escalation via state machine, FAQ-powered responses with confidence scoring, sentiment detection, auto-resolution, and smart escalation with context preservation. Dual notification systems (chat announcements and database notifications). **All AI token usage (greetings, responses, sentiment analysis) is automatically tracked and billed to customer workspaces** via `usageMeteringService` to ensure platform profitability.
    - **DispatchOS™ - Computer-Aided Dispatch**: **IMPLEMENTED November 2025** - Full-stack real-time CAD system for emergency services. Backend implementation complete with 494-line service layer (`server/services/dispatch.ts`), 303-line REST API routes (`server/routes/dispatch.ts`), and 77 lines of WebSocket broadcasts (`server/websocket.ts`). Features: GPS tracking with 10-second updates, unit status management (available/en_route/on_scene/offline), incident queue with priority-based assignment (emergency/urgent/routine), dispatcher command center, and comprehensive audit logging.
