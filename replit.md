# AutoForce™

## Overview
AutoForce™ (Autonomous Workforce Management Solutions) is a comprehensive workforce management platform designed for emergency services and other service-related industries. Its primary goal is to streamline operations, reduce administrative burdens, and serve as a single source of truth for workforce management. Key features include time tracking with advanced verification, automated invoice generation, smart hiring, compliance audit trails, and real-time analytics. The platform employs an "OS" design philosophy for extensibility and aims for a hybrid subscription and usage-based AI revenue model.

## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations.
Do not make changes to the folder `Z`.
Do not make changes to the file `Y`.
All branding must be 100% AutoForce™ (not WorkforceOS).
FTC COMPLIANCE: All marketing claims must be factual and verifiable. Avoid monopolistic language.
DESIGN: Professional Fortune 500 aesthetic - NO bright glowing colors (green-500, blue-500, amber-500, etc.). Use muted professional tones from design_guidelines.md only.
No Refresh Buttons.
Universal Back Navigation: Every page, modal, dialog needs clear exit/cancel/back buttons.
Unsaved Changes Protection: Forms and pages with editable content must warn users before navigation/close.

## System Architecture
AutoForce™ is built on a modular "OS" design philosophy (e.g., BillOS™, PayrollOS™, TrackOS™) to ensure clean code and extensibility.

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a professional aesthetic using Deep Charcoal, Platinum neutrals, and Evergreen/Steel Blue/Professional Teal accents as defined in `design_guidelines.md`. It prioritizes a mobile-first approach with responsive layouts, accessible touch targets, and PWA capabilities. Branding includes an "AF" lightning bolt logo within a circular green gradient badge. Key navigation elements include a floating header, visible labels for navigation buttons, and contextual breadcrumb navigation.
