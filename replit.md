# WorkforceOS

## Overview
WorkforceOS is a comprehensive workforce management operating system designed to automate HR functions for businesses. It offers features such as time tracking, automated invoice generation, smart hiring, compliance audit trails, and real-time analytics. The platform aims to provide significant cost savings by integrating various HR functions into a single system, envisioning branded features for a unified product identity. The project also focuses on monopolistic features to provide complete employee lifecycle management, granular role-based access control, and platform-level troubleshooting, justifying a premium pricing model.

## System Architecture
### Organization Principles
- **Modular OS Design**: Features are organized into branded "OS" modules (e.g., BillOS™, PayrollOS™, TrackOS™, TrainingOS™, BudgetOS™, EngagementOS™, IntegrationOS™).
- **Extend, Don't Rebuild**: Emphasizes building on existing systems.
- **Clean Code**: Code is organized by category/version for independent upgrades.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each feature domain has a single authoritative system.

### Platform Revenue Model: Service Middleman Fee System
**Data Flow**: Time Tracking → Payroll Calculation → Invoice Generation → Platform Fee Collection

1. **Time Tracking** (`/time-tracking`, `timeEntries` table):
   - Employees clock in/out via TIME CLOCK tab
   - Records stored in `timeEntries` table with GPS coordinates, IP address, clock in/out timestamps
   - Status tracked as 'active' (clocked in) or 'completed' (clocked out)
   - Billing status tracked as 'unbilled', 'billed', or 'paid'

2. **Payroll Automation** (`server/services/payrollAutomation.ts`):
   - Service queries all unbilled time entries for payroll processing
   - Calculates hours worked from clock in/out timestamps
   - Multiplies hours × employee wage rate = gross pay
   - Applies deductions (taxes, benefits) for net pay calculation
   - Creates payroll records tied to specific time entries
   - Marks time entries as 'billed' when payroll runs

3. **Invoice Generation** (`server/routes.ts`, `invoices` & `invoiceLineItems` tables):
   - For clients with `billingCycle: 'auto'`, system auto-generates invoices
   - Each invoice line item references the source time entry via `timeEntryId`
   - Line item includes: description, hours worked, rate, subtotal
   - Invoice totals calculated from all line items for that billing period
   - **Platform fee calculated as percentage of invoice total**

4. **Platform Fee Revenue**:
   - AutoForce™ acts as middleman between workforce provider (client) and employees
   - Client pays invoice total (employee wages + platform fee)
   - Platform retains fee percentage, passes remainder to workforce provider
   - Fee structure supports SaaS business model as transaction-based revenue
   - All fees tracked in invoice records for financial reporting

**Key Tables:**
- `timeEntries`: Raw clock in/out data with GPS/IP tracking
- `payrollRecords`: Calculated payroll from time entries
- `invoices`: Auto-generated bills for clients with billing automation
- `invoiceLineItems`: Individual charges tied to specific time entries (via `timeEntryId`)
- `clients`: Stores billing preferences (`billingCycle: 'auto' | 'manual'`)

**User Journey:**
1. Manager creates shifts in ScheduleOS™ (schedule-grid.tsx)
2. Employee clocks in/out via TIME CLOCK tab → /time-tracking page
3. Payroll automation runs (scheduled job) → processes unbilled time entries
4. Invoice generation creates bills for auto-billing clients
5. Platform collects fees as percentage of invoice total
6. Financial reports show platform revenue from transaction fees

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a CAD-style professional interface with a dark mode theme, emphasizing precision. It includes an application frame with a menu, toolbar, and status bar. The design is modern, professional, mobile-first, and utilizes corporate blue gradient accents. The official logo is a realistic neon-style "W" with glowing "OS" superscript. A universal transition system provides smooth visual feedback. Key UI components include tab-based navigation, collapsible sections, and mobile-optimized design elements. All acceptance forms have both accept and decline options. Enhanced empty states utilize animated gradient backgrounds, layered icon containers, and decorative spinning rings.

**Navigation Pattern (2024-11-04)**: All feature pages include Back/Home navigation buttons to prevent users from getting lost. Time Tracking includes Back arrow (ArrowLeft) + Dashboard button with Home icon. Schedule Grid includes Dashboard button in top toolbar. All navigation uses wouter's Link component for client-side routing, with data-testid attributes for testing. Mobile-responsive with proper spacing and tooltips.
